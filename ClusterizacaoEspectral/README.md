## Spectral clustering algorithm

<p align="justify"> The algorithm generates RAW groups and increases the performance of networks with hidden terminals. The spectral clustering is based on the well-known K-Means algorithm. However, unlike previous proposals found in the literature, it uses RSSI information between stations instead of their geographical locations. The proposed method is more feasible to implement in practice as RSSI information can be easily obtained in most networks unlike the geographical positions of nodes required by other K-Means based approaches.
