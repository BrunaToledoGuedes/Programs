## Original K-Means
<p align="justify"> K-Means is a clustering algorithm that aims to group a data set into a K number of clusters. K-Means starts by defining the positions of the initial centroids of the clusters randomly, being assigned the same geographic position of each of the stations in the dataset. In this algorithm, a maximum of 20 iterations are performed, if the clusters do not stabilize, the process is interrupted on the twentieth attempt. After defining the initial centroids, the iterations begin. Then, the distance of the stations for each centroid is calculated. The station will be assigned to the nearest centroid. After distributing the stations in the clusters, it is verified if there was a change in the position of the centroids. If the centroids have stopped moving, then the loop is stopped, it will not always be necessary to iterate 20 times.
